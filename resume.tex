\section{\underline{EXPERIENCE}}

\textbf{ByteDance} $|$ Seattle, WA \hfill Q3 2023 -- Present\\
{\sl Machine Learning Infrastructure Engineer (Platform Team)}
\begin{itemize} \itemsep 2pt
  \item \textbf{Cut idle GPU hours by $\sim$30\%} by building custom resource scheduler scaling on worker utilization instead of raw GPU utilization, reducing infra costs across production ML workloads
  \item \textbf{Sustained 2k+ QPS and hundreds of millions of tasks monthly} by building v2 async job queue (Redis, MongoDB, S3-equivalent), enabling dynamic workflows for TikTok ML features

  \item \textbf{Delivered 99.99\% availability across US, EU, and ROW} by deploying multi-region clusters with disaster recovery and automated failover, ensuring uninterrupted TikTok ML workloads during data center outages
  \item \textbf{Maintained uninterrupted operation of mission-critical async job queue} by onboarding 6 engineers during turnover cycles, authoring runbooks, and mentoring successors into ownership
\end{itemize}


\textbf{ByteDance} $|$ San Jose, CA (Remote) \hfill 2022 -- Q1 2024\\
{\sl Machine Learning Optimization Engineer}
\begin{itemize} \itemsep 2pt
  \item \textbf{Cut training costs by $\sim$\$1.5M/month ($>$6M in H1 2023)} by accelerating SDXL throughput 4.7× on 1k A100s; earned internal excellence award and partnered with NVIDIA NeMo on kernel-level optimizations
  \item \textbf{Saved $\sim$10M GPU-hours and cut training latency up to 4×} on A10 GPUs by optimizing diffusion model training for TikTok features (AI Self, AI Moji), powering 100M+ generations
  \item \textbf{Expanded compute capacity during GPU shortages} by evaluating 256 TPUs and migration tradeoffs, securing additional A100 GPUs through strategic resource exchange
  \item \textbf{Recognized as ML optimization expert} supporting $\sim$100 engineers; led deep dives on FSDP, DeepSpeed, and Megatron, and shaped PhD intern pipeline through $\sim$100 resume screens and $\sim$10 interviews
\end{itemize}



\textbf{ByteDance} $|$ San Jose, CA (Remote) \hfill Summer 2021\\
{\sl Software Engineering Intern — ML Systems}
\begin{itemize} \itemsep 2pt
  \item \textbf{Enabled parameter-server scaling for ML researchers} by adding BytePS distributed backend support to an internal PyTorch-based training framework
  \item \textbf{Improved training efficiency and prevented costly misconfigured runs} by implementing profiling, config validation, and early stopping features
  \item \textbf{Extended internal PyTorch training framework}, later adopted by multiple research teams, strengthening department-wide ML infrastructure

\end{itemize}
